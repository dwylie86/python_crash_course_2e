# A list is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that
# includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0–9, or the names of
# all the people in your family.
# In Python, square brackets ([]) indicate a list, and individual elements
# in the list are separated by commas. Here’s a simple example of a list that
# contains a few kinds of bicycles:
bicycles = ['trek', 'canondale','redline', 'specialized',]
print(bicycles)

# Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by
# telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired. To access an element in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item
# enclosed in square brackets. Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1
# For example, let’s pull out the first bicycle in the list bicycles:

print(bicycles[0])

# You can format with the title/upper/lower methods also
print(bicycles[0].title())
print(bicycles[1])
print(bicycles[3])

# Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list.
# By asking for the item at index -1, Python always returns the last item in the list:
print(bicycles[-1])

# You can use individual values from a list just as you would any other variable. For example, you can use f-strings to create a message based on a
# value from a list.
message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycles[0].title()}"

print(message)

# Names Challenge
friends = ['marko', 'flarko', 'banarko', 'stan']
print(friends[0])

print(flarko_message)
banarko_message = f"Hello, my dear friend {friends[2].title()}, how very nice to see you."
print(banarko_message)
stan_message = f"Hello, my dear friend {friends[3].title()}, how very nice to see you."
print(stan_message)

# Own list challenge
own_list = ['honda', 'flonda', 'moronda', 'banana']
own_message = f"I would like to own a {own_list[0].title()} CRX."

name_message = f"I would name my child {own_list[2].title()} if I could."
