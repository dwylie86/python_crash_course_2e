# Numbers in variables are integers or floating decimal numbers (Floats). Integers are whole numbers only.

# Integers
# You can add(*), subtract(-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers
# Examples below are run from the terminal and copied in as comments
# >>> 2+3
# 5
# >>> 3-2
# 1
# >>> 2*3
# 6
# >>> 3 / 2
# 1.5

# (**) raises a number by an exponent 3 ** 2 (3^2)
# >>> 3 ** 2
# 9
# >>> 3 ** 3
# 27
# >>> 10 ** 6
# 1000000

# Python supports order of opertions (PEMDAS) Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction
# >>> 2 + 3*4
# 14
# >>> (2+3)*4
# 20

# Floats are any number with a decimal point
# For the most part, you can add(*), subtract(-), multiply (*), and divide (/) floats
# >>> 0.1 + 0.1
# 0.2
# >>> 0.2 + 0.2
# 0.4
# >>> 2 * 0.1
# 0.2
# >>> 2 * 0.2
# 0.4

# However, sometimes Python throws you an arbitrary number of decimal places in your answer
# >>> 0.2 + 0.1
# 0.30000000000000004
# >>> 3 * 0.1
# 0.30000000000000004

# When you divide any two numbers, the result will always be a float.
# >>> 4/2
# 2.0
# If you mix an integer and a float, the result will always be a float.
# >>> 1+2.0
# 3.0
# >>> 2*3.0
# 6.0
# >>> 3.0*2
# 6.0

# Underscores in Numbers
# Help when making long digits more readable in the variable but do not print out in the terminal
# >>> universe_age = 14_000_000_000
# >>> print(universe_age)
# 14000000000

# Multiple Assignment
# You can assign more than on variable using a single line, by separting them with commas
# >>> x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
# >>> print(x)
# 1
# >>> print(y)
# 2
# >>> print(z)
# 3

# Constants are variables that stay the same throughout the life of a program. Although Python does have built in
# constant types they are denoted by programmers by being written in ALL CAPS.
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000

# Numbers Challenge
print(7+1)
print(13-5)
print(2*4)
# Remember: Division always results in a float
print(24/3)

# My Favorite Number Challenge
favorite_number = 4
message = f"My favorite number is {favorite_number}."
print(message)
